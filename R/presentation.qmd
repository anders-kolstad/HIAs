## Horizontal aggregation of spatially biased ecosystem condition indicators â€“ a GIS based workflow

<br> *1st draft* - aimed at Ecosystem Indicators

## Question

-   Is there a way to make use of spatially biased data in ecosystem condition indicators?\

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
Ecosystem condition indicators should be wall-to-wall. For municipalities with little available data, the indicators values could be inferred from projections based on a model. If municipalities are somehow judged based on their indicator scores, it is not ideal if this is based on an assumption that all municipality are the same.
:::

-   Can we make local wall-to-wall indicator maps from sporadic data without relying on data from other municipalities?
